## Title: Exercise 8_2 â€“ Operator overloading with non-member functions

## Objective: Allow the student to explore the creation of an operator overload using non-member friend functions

## Statement of Problem:

with a non-member friend function. Hint: You should not have to modify your program file (i.e.
main) to get the exact same results as Exercise 8_1.
